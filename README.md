# Facial_recognition
The code trains a network to find the dissimilarity between two images using CNN which can be used for facial recognition and detection. This is implemented using pytorch. 
The trainig data should be in data folder and the data for testing in testing folder. I have trained the network using AT&T face dataset, which is easily available online.
